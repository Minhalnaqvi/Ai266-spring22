### Problems That I Counter In AI Project : 
- Initially its challenging to identify which columns are **dependant** or **independant** to **target** feild.
- Data contains some independant feilds like **feature_27** so I used **exploratory data analysis** to clean the data first.
- I used **perceptron neural network** to train the dataset because competition is based on **supervised learning** 
       the main reason is that it has been considered to be a **fast and reliable solution** in the group of mathematical problem-solving.
