My name is mustajab amin and i have trained data using KNN model
i have faced the problem of parameter tuning , i have set it initially around 1-30 but it took too long and didnt respond.then i have changed it value to 1-5 and got some accuracy around 0.6185.
i have got diiferent accuracy using different parameters. with change in number of neighbours accuracy changes along with change in cv value. when i set neighbours value to 15 my accuracy was 0.65432 and when i changed it to 4 neighbours my accuracy decline to 0.6185.  the value for cv was set at 5 at both the occasion.
