### Difficulties That I Faced :
- In csv's data is unclean so i used pandas to clean the data first.
- Initially i used naive bayes to train my model but its accuracy is not high so i used other model that is decision tree classifier that has higher accuracy in comparison of my initial naive bayes model.
