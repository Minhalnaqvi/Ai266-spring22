# ***About Minhal Naqvi:***

My name is Minhal Naqvi I am student of BSCS. I like to do Graphic designing.I also teach Quran I think anything we do in timely manner leads to successful life moreover I hope this course helps me to do something creative in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

# Special Mention

CA means creative artist

# Why BSCS?

I think I chosen this field as is is related to computer and I am using computer since my childhood so due to a kind of interset in computer I had chosen.

# Why Ai if elective?

Actually I dont have much knowledge about Ai but as much as I know it means to make machine intelligent for doing any task and I maybe not choose Ai if it is elective as making machine intelligent is not our primary goal I think first of all human should be make human I am not against Ai It has it's own importance and application but my point is our first priority should be the first one for which no one has designed any course.
